                <p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Front end developers build with the user in mind.</b> Front end development is a style of computer programming that focuses on the coding and creation of elements and features of a website that will be seen by the user.
                    It's about making sure the visual aspects of a website are functional. You can also think of front end as the “client side” of an application. Let's say you're a front end developer. This means your job is to code and bring to life
                    the visual elements of a website. You'd be more focused on what the user sees when they visit a website or app. And, you'd want to make sure the site is easy to interact with while also running smoothly. </p>
                <p class="para">These developers take the visual designs from UX and UI designers and bring the website to life, making sure it functions well for the user. One of the many ways you could use front end skills is in creating a static website, which is
                    a website with fixed content that's delivered to a user's browser exactly as it's stored. You might run into a <u><b>static website</b></u> if you happen upon a simple landing page or a small business website that doesn't allow users
                    to perform any interactive tasks.</p>
                <p class="para">Front end developers build elements like:</p>
                <ol class="ord" type="A" style="color: orangered;">
                    <li>Buttons</li>
                    <li>Layouts</li>
                    <li>Navigation</li>
                    <li>Images</li>
                    <li>Graphics</li>
                    <li>Content organization</li>
                    <li>Animations</li>

            <div class="col">
                <h2 style="color: orangered;">Back End Development :</h2>
                <p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Back end development focuses on the side of the website users can't see</b> It's what makes a site interactive. The back end can also be referred to as the “server side” of a website. As an example, let's say you're running
                    a social media website. You need an accessible place to store all of your users information. This storage center is called a database and a few widely used examples include Oracle, SQL Server, and MySQL. Databases are run from a server,
                    which is essentially a remote computer. A back end developer will help manage this database and the site contents stored on it. This ensures that front end elements on your social media website can continue to function properly as
                    users browse uploaded content and other user profiles. </p>
                <p class="para">While users do not directly interact with the back end of a website, they’ll indirectly interact with elements these developers work on through a front-end application. Back end development deals with storing and arranging data while also
                    ensuring the front end is functioning well. </p>

                <p class="para">Back end web developers work on tasks like: </p>
                <ol class="ord" type="A" style="color: orangered;">
                    <li>Building code</li>
                    <li>Troubleshooting and debugging web applications</li>
                    <li>Database management</li>
                    <li>Framework utilization</li>
